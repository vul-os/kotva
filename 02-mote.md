# 2. The MOTE Object

A **MOTE** (the atomic unit of DMTAP) is a signed, encrypted, content-addressed message
object. Mail, chat messages, file-share announcements, group events, and identity
announcements are all MOTEs — one format, rendered differently by clients (§5, §8).

## 2.1 Layered structure

A MOTE has three nested layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph OUTER["Outer — mixnet / sealed sender · §4, §6"]
    direction TB
    O["routing to the recipient node<br/><i>NO sender identity in clear</i>"]
    subgraph ENV["Envelope — signed, per-recipient · §2.2"]
      direction TB
      E["authenticity + integrity<br/><i>content-addressed id</i>"]
      subgraph PAY["Payload — MLS/HPKE ciphertext · §2.4"]
        P["the actual content:<br/>headers + body + attachments"]
      end
    end
  end
```

The **outer** layer is what mix nodes and relays see: an onion-wrapped, constant-length
(padded) packet with no clear-text sender (sealed sender, §6). The **envelope** provides
authenticity to the recipient. The **payload** is the end-to-end-encrypted content.

## 2.2 Envelope (CBOR)

```
Envelope {
  v:        u8,             // format version (0)
  suite:    u8,             // algorithm suite (§1.1)
  id:       bytes,          // content address of `ciphertext` (§2.2, hash-agile)
  to:       DeliveryTag,    // routing target: recipient key, group id, or blinded tag (§2.2a)
  epoch:    ?bytes,         // MLS group epoch / group context ref, if group (§5)
  ts:       u64,            // sender timestamp (ms epoch)
  kind:     u8,             // message kind (§2.3)
  keypkg:   ?KeyPackageRef, // present iff this initiates an MLS session (async join, §5.3)
  challenge: ?ChallengeResponse, // anti-abuse proof for cold senders (§2.2b, §9) —
                                 //   verifiable WITHOUT decrypting `ciphertext`
  ciphertext: bytes,        // MLS or HPKE sealed Payload (§2.4)
  sender_key: bytes,        // EPHEMERAL per-message PUBLIC key; the verification key for
                            //   `sender_sig`. Fresh per message ⇒ unlinkable, reveals no identity.
  sender_sig: bytes,        // detached sig by `sender_key`'s secret over the §18.9.1
                            //   preimage; gates abuse, reveals no identity
}
```

- **`id`** — content address = a 1-byte **hash-algorithm prefix** (multihash-style, for
  agility) followed by the digest. v0 default is **BLAKE3-256** (128-bit collision resistance,
  equal to SHA-256; fast Merkle/XOF structure ideal for chunking). BLAKE3 is cryptographically
  sound but **not FIPS/IETF-standardized** (the IETF draft expired); the agility prefix lets an
  implementation migrate to SHA-256/SHA-3 where compliance requires it without changing the
  address format. Pin the exact BLAKE3 mode + 256-bit output. Content addressing gives
  deduplication, integrity, and cacheability for free; identical ciphertext shares an `id`.
- **Signature placement.** For sealed-sender messages the *authenticating* signature and the
  sender's identity live **inside** the encrypted payload (`Payload.from`, `Payload.sig`),
  so intermediaries never see who signed. `sender_sig` in the envelope is a
  detached signature by an *ephemeral* per-message key (unlinkable) used only for
  spam/abuse gating at the recipient (§9); it does not reveal identity. The matching
  **public** key travels in `sender_key` so the recipient can verify `sender_sig`
  *before decrypting* (§2.7 step 3) — there is no persistent key to look up, and a fresh
  keypair per message means `sender_key` is itself unlinkable. Every `challenge` type
  **except a vouch** MUST be bound to `sender_key` (§9) — an ARC token is issued to it; a
  PoW/stamp commits to it (§9.4) — so that a captured proof cannot be re-signed onto another
  envelope with a different ephemeral key. A vouch cannot be sender_key-bound and is instead
  **subject**-bound, checked post-decryption at §2.7 step 8(b2) (§9.2a).
- **`epoch`** ties a message to an MLS group epoch so the recipient selects the right key.

### 2.2a Delivery tag (`to`) and recipient blinding

`to` is a **`DeliveryTag`**, one of:

- the recipient's **identity key** — the **first-contact** form, simplest, and the only option
  before a per-contact secret exists. It carries **no sender information** (it is the recipient's
  own key), so an envelope bearing it is always classified **cold** at §2.7 step 5; a known contact
  MUST move to a blinded tag; or
- a **group id** (for MLS group messages, §5); or
- a **blinded delivery tag** — a per-contact value `BT = HKDF-SHA256(shared_secret, …)` derived
  from a secret established at first contact (`epoch_day` is the **day-counter epoch**, §0.8 —
  distinct from an MLS group epoch or a mix-key epoch) — the KDF, inputs, and 16-byte length are
  pinned in [§18.3.2](18-wire-format.md) — which the recipient's node recognizes but which is
  **unlinkable across time and across observers** to the recipient's persistent key.

Blinded tags are RECOMMENDED for the `private` tier. **Honest limit (reconciled with §6.4):**
even a blinded tag does not hide *that a packet was delivered to a particular node* from the
final mix / an observer of the recipient's link — an always-on node has a stable network
presence (§6.4). Blinding removes the *persistent-key* linkage in the envelope; it does not
remove last-hop delivery observability, which §6.4 addresses with node/identity decoupling and
recipient-side cover traffic. Implementations MUST NOT present blinded tags as full recipient
anonymity.

### 2.2b Anti-abuse challenge (`challenge`)

`challenge` is an optional `ChallengeResponse` carrying the sender's proof for cold contact
(§9): an **ARC token**, a **proof-of-work solution**, a **postage stamp**, or a **vouch**. It is
placed in the *envelope* (not the payload) so the recipient can evaluate abuse policy **without
decrypting** — see the validation order in §2.7. Known contacts omit it (their MOTEs are
accepted on the fast path). See §9 for the grammar, issuer-trust rules, and each proof type.

## 2.3 Message kinds

```
0x00  mail            long-form message (email semantics)
0x01  chat            short message (chat semantics)
0x02  reaction        emoji/ack on a referenced MOTE
0x03  edit            supersede a referenced MOTE
0x04  redact          request deletion of a referenced MOTE
0x05  file_offer      manifest + key for a content-addressed file (§5.5)
0x06  group_event     MLS handshake / membership change (§5.3)
0x07  receipt         delivery/read receipt (opt-in; §6)
0x08  presence        ephemeral presence/typing (opt-in, off by default; §6)
0x09  identity        Identity/Move/RecoveryPolicy announcement (§1)
0x0a  system          protocol control (capability negotiation, §10)
0x0b  deniable        optional deniable 1:1 transport frame (§5.2.1); real content kind rides inside
0x40–0x7f  reserved for extensions (§10)
```

`0x40 pub_announce` is allocated from the extension range to the DMTAP-PUB extension (§22): a
public signed announcement, plaintext, openly signed by the publisher identity (no sealed
sender). Unlike the kinds above, a `pub_announce` is a **bare signed object, not a MOTE** — it
never rides inside an `Envelope`; it is fetched by content address (§22.3).

**Unknown kinds (normative).** A recipient MUST NOT `ack` a kind it does not implement.
Unknown kinds — unassigned, or assigned but unimplemented — are **ignored** (not surfaced, not
acked, MAY be discarded or held), never rejected as malformed (§21.16, §2.7 unknown-kind gate).

`mail` and `chat` differ only in default client rendering (§8), not in default privacy tier:
both default to the `fast` tier (§4.6); a client MAY let a user opt into the `private`
research-tier mixnet. Both are the same object over the same transport.

## 2.4 Payload (CBOR, encrypted)

The plaintext that is sealed into `Envelope.ciphertext`:

```
Payload {
  from:     bytes,          // sender identity key (IK) — revealed only to the recipient
  sig:      bytes,          // IK (or device key) over the canonical payload hash
  headers:  Headers,
  body:     Body,
  refs:     [* bytes],      // ids of MOTEs this replies to / references (threading)
  attach:   [* Attachment], // §2.5
  expires:  ?u64,           // requested expiry (client-enforced deletion)
  provenance: ?[+ GatewayAttestation],  // sealed gateway-attestation chain (§7.8, §18.3.11);
                            //   present iff gateway-touched, absent ⇒ provably pure-mesh
}

Headers {
  thread:    ?bytes,        // stable thread/conversation id
  subject:   ?tstr,         // mail only
  mime:      ?tstr,         // content type of `body`
  cc:        [* bytes],     // additional recipient keys (fan-out is per-recipient MOTEs)
  ext:       { * tstr => ext-value },  // extension headers (§10); typed, NOT `any` — see §18.3.6
  sensitive: ?bool,         // key 6: no-persist / ephemeral-view (§6.7); §18.3.6 is authoritative
}

Body = tstr / bytes         // text or opaque MIME
```

Only the recipient (or group members) can decrypt `Payload`, so **all sender identity,
subject, recipients, threading, and content are hidden from the network** — this is what
sealed sender + payload encryption buys.

**HPKE mode: Base, not Auth (pinned here; the binding requirement is §18.2).** The
pre-session/first-contact seal of `Payload` into `Envelope.ciphertext` (§5.2) — an HPKE seal
directly to the recipient's identity/KeyPackage key — is fixed to HPKE **Base mode** (RFC 9180
§5.1.1, `mode = 0x00` per Table 1), never HPKE Auth mode (`mode = 0x02`) or either PSK variant
(`0x01`/`0x03`). Sender authentication for a sealed MOTE is `Payload.sig` over `Payload.from`
(above), carried and verified **inside** the HPKE-decrypted plaintext by the recipient alone —
not HPKE's own KEM-level sender-key binding. Auth mode would fold the sender's static key into
the KEM encapsulation itself, adding a second, unaudited authentication path that duplicates
`Payload.sig` and that the recipient's HPKE context would need to resolve *before* the seal is
even opened — which cuts against sealed sender (§6.2): the whole point of carrying the
signature inside the payload, rather than at the KEM layer, is that nothing outside the
recipient — including the HPKE mechanism itself — learns who sent the message. §18.2 states
the binding requirement for the wire encoding.

**`fs_ratchet` is removed (was: `?bytes`, "forward-secrecy ratchet material," §5.2).** The field
was OPTIONAL and opaque, and never given a preimage, derivation, or verifier anywhere in the
specification; retrofitting real semantics onto it would either duplicate the MLS epoch mechanism
(§5.1) for an established group or reintroduce a second per-message ratchet protocol outside the
optional deniable mode (§5.2.1), so it is deleted rather than left as an undefined field that
invites an implementer to assume FS is handled elsewhere. The resulting gap — HPKE-sealed
1:1/first-contact MOTEs carry no pre-session forward secrecy — is disclosed, not papered over
(§5.2, §6.9 SP-6). **§18.3.5's `Payload` CDDL carries the corresponding key (8, `fs_ratchet`) and
needs the matching removal (or an explicit `Reserved — do not assign` marking if the key number
must not be reused); reported to the §18 owner.**

## 2.5 Attachments and files

Small attachments MAY be inlined into `Payload.attach`. Larger files MUST be referenced by a
content-addressed **manifest**; **normal-tier** chunks (≤ 4 MiB) transfer via **whichever tier the
message itself uses** — default `fast`, or the opt-in research-tier mixnet if the sender selected it —
and **large-tier** chunks via the `fast`/direct swarmed bulk path, which **MUST NOT** traverse the
mixnet at all (§4.5). This is what makes
DMTAP a file-share of arbitrary size (no protocol cap).

```
Attachment {
  name:     tstr,
  mime:     tstr,
  size:     u64,
  inline:   ?bytes,         // present iff small
  manifest: ?ManifestRef,   // present iff large (§5.5); wire shape is §18.3.7, the sole
                            //   authority (id/size/chunks + durability, MUST for
                            //   Referenced tier; advisory holder_hint) — not repeated here
  key:      bytes,          // per-file content key (recipient decrypts chunks)
}
```

The manifest lists chunk hashes (a BLAKE3 Merkle DAG). Chunks are fixed-size, individually
encrypted and content-addressed, enabling **resumable, parallel, swarmed, deduplicated**
transfer. Only the manifest + `key` travel in the (private) MOTE; the chunks travel per the
size tier below — normal-tier via whichever tier the message itself uses (default `fast`, or
the opt-in research-tier mixnet if a sender has selected it), large-tier via the `fast`/direct
swarmed bulk path, which **MUST NOT** traverse the mixnet (§4.5). See §5.5 for the full file model.

**Metadata-privacy size tiers (normative threshold, reconciles §2.5 / §4.5 / §6.5).** These are
**metadata-privacy tiers** — they fix which *path* the bytes take and what an observer can
learn; the **durability tiers** of §5.5.1 (who holds the bytes, and for how long) are an
orthogonal axis. A file is handled by one of three paths, by size:

| Tier | Size | Path | Metadata privacy |
|------|------|------|------------------|
| **inline** | ≤ v0 **48 KiB** of content — the padded MOTE then rides the top bucket rung, 64 KiB = 32 Sphinx cells, opt-in research-tier mixnet only ([docs/research/mixnet.md §4.4.1](docs/research/mixnet.md)/§16.3); the 16 KiB gap is ≈12 kB PQ envelope plus ≈4.4 kB header/framing headroom (§5.5.1) | in `Attachment.inline`, inside the MOTE | full (rides the message's tier) |
| **normal** | > inline, ≤ 4 chunks (v0: ≤ 4 MiB) | manifest in MOTE; **chunks route via whichever tier the message uses** — default `fast`, or the opt-in research-tier mixnet if selected | full when the opt-in mixnet is in use; the default `fast` tier's guarantee otherwise (like messages, §6.5) |
| **large** | > normal | manifest in MOTE; **chunks via the `fast`/onion bulk path** (§4.5) | weaker — Tor-class (§6.5) |

The v0 numeric thresholds (48 KiB / 4 MiB) are parameters (§16.4) and MAY be tuned;
the three-tier model is normative. This removes the earlier binary small/large ambiguity.
**Note on "inline" and the mixnet cell:** an inline payload is **not** a single mix packet — the
Sphinx cell is 2 KiB (§16.3), so a padded inline MOTE is a **whole number of 2 KiB cells** on the
**bucket ladder** {16, 64} KiB ([docs/research/mixnet.md §4.4.1](docs/research/mixnet.md)) — i.e.
8 or 32 cells. The inline tier's ceiling is the
**top rung** (64 KiB, 32 cells), not one packet; the byte-level derivation of the 48 KiB cap from
that rung is §5.5.1's (11.9 kB PQ envelope + 4.4 kB headroom). Only ladder sizes appear on the
wire, so size still leaks nothing — the metadata-privacy point §5.5.1 does not itself make.
There is also **no 2 KiB and no 8 KiB rung**: a conformant PQ envelope (suite `0x02`, §1.1)
already exceeds 11.9 kB before any body at all, so the floor the arithmetic forces is 16 KiB in v0.

## 2.6 Delivery semantics

```
deliver(outer_mote)   → recipient node receives, unwraps outer, verifies envelope,
                         decrypts payload, stores, and returns:
ack(id)               → recipient confirms receipt of MOTE `id`.
```

- **`ack(id)` transport (normative — signing is MUST, not an optional hardening).** An `ack` is a
  **small signed control MOTE** (kind `system`, §2.3) — or, on a live direct/`fast` connection, a
  transport-level ack over the same channel — carrying `id`, and it **MUST** be signed (§19.3.2:
  this was previously an OPTIONAL implementation hardening, which is corrected here) by a key
  currently authorized under the recipient's pinned identity: the `IK` itself, or a non-revoked
  `DeviceCert`-chained device key (§1.2) — the identical authorization test §5.6.1 already applies
  to cluster-sync peers. The sender's retry queue (§4.7) MUST verify this signature before
  transitioning to `ACKED` (§20.1); an unsigned, wrongly-signed, or unauthorized-key ack MUST be
  ignored — it is not delivery evidence. An `ack` **MUST travel at the same privacy tier as the
  MOTE it acknowledges** (a `private`-tier MOTE's ack MUST NOT be downgraded to `fast` for
  convenience — the same no-silent-downgrade discipline as
  [docs/research/mixnet.md §4.4.9](docs/research/mixnet.md)). Acks are not themselves acked
  (no ack storm). See §19.3.2 for the CDDL this requires and the full rationale, and §6.9 SP-2 for
  the disclosed residual (a signature necessarily proves a *specific device* produced it — a
  stronger identity commitment than an unsigned event carried).
- **Durability = the sender's node retries** until `ack`, with exponential backoff and an
  `expires`-bounded deadline. The mixnet/relay holds nothing durably.
- **Deduplication.** A recipient re-acks only an `id` it has **previously acked** (a stored,
  inbox-delivered MOTE): such a redelivery is acked immediately without re-processing. An `id`
  held **only in the deferred requests area** (§2.7a) is NOT acked on redelivery — re-acking it
  would leak, to an unproven sender probing with a duplicate, exactly the existence confirmation
  the requests-area no-ack rule withholds.
- **Retry deadline when `expires` is absent.** When `expires` is absent, the retry deadline is
  the §16.1 default maximum retry lifetime; retry is always bounded.
- **Ordering.** MOTEs are not globally ordered; `ts` + `refs` + (for groups) the MLS group
  `epoch` provide causal/threading order. Clients MUST tolerate out-of-order and duplicate delivery.

## 2.7 Validation (recipient MUST)

Validation is ordered **cheapest-and-anonymous first**, so a flood of cold junk is rejected
*before* any expensive asymmetric decryption (a decryption-DoS defense). On receipt a node MUST,
in order:

1. Reject unknown `v`/`suite` (fail closed).
2. Verify `id` matches the content address of `ciphertext` (§2.2); drop on mismatch.
3. Verify `sender_sig` over the **§18.9.1 preimage** (DS-tagged; `to` as deterministic CBOR,
   `ts` as u64 big-endian, `kind` as one byte, absent `challenge` as `0xf6`) under
   **`sender_key`** — the ephemeral per-message public key carried in the same envelope (cheap;
   no decryption). Drop on failure.
   `sender_key` is trusted only as the abuse-gate key for *this* envelope; it asserts no identity
   (identity is authenticated later, inside `ciphertext`, at step 8). The `challenge` at step 6 —
   **every type except a vouch** — MUST be bound to `sender_key` (§9.4), so this step also fixes
   which ephemeral key the abuse proof was minted for; a vouch is subject-bound instead, at step
   8(b2) (§9.2a).
3a. **Freshness (replay bound, normative).** Reject a MOTE whose `ts` (§2.2) is more than the
   **clock-skew tolerance** (§16.1, ±120 s) ahead of the receiver's clock, **or** more than the
   **durable seen-id horizon** (§16.10) in the past. Drop on failure — same disposition as step 3
   (no ack; a duplicate of an `id` already acked is still re-acked per §2.6, since that rule runs
   at step 9 and is unaffected by this step). Two conditions are checked, not one, because they
   defend against different things and a single symmetric window cannot serve both:
   - **Too far in the future** catches a broken or lying clock — the pre-existing, narrow ±120 s
     bound (`ERR_TIMESTAMP_OUT_OF_SKEW`, `0x020C`, already registered in §21 but, until this fix,
     never actually wired into this procedure — a MOTE could not fail a check the validation steps
     never performed).
   - **Too far in the past** catches replay of a captured, validly-signed MOTE **after** it has
     aged out of the node's dedup cache (§2.6) but is presented again with every other check —
     `sender_sig`, `Payload.sig`, decryption — still passing, because nothing before this fix
     bounded how old an accepted `ts` may be. This bound MUST NOT be the same ±120 s figure used
     for the future direction: `ts` is fixed at a MOTE's original construction and does **not**
     change across a sender's retries (§20.1 keeps the envelope `id` — and therefore, since
     `Payload.sig`'s preimage binds `ts`, §18.9.2, the `ts` itself — stable across every
     re-onion-wrap), so a 120 s past-bound would reject a message still legitimately retrying at
     hour 71 of its 72 h deadline (§16.1), or one delivered from a 20-day offline buffer
     (§16.6/§14.5) the moment it drains. The past bound MUST instead be **at least as large as**
     the longer of the retry deadline and the offline-buffer TTL — which is exactly what the
     durable seen-id horizon (§16.10, currently 20 days) already is. Using that one figure for
     both the freshness past-bound and the dedup-cache retention is the point: freshness and
     dedup lifetime become **the same bound**, not the three different figures (§16.1's "≥ 300 s"
     replay-cache retention, §16.10's 20-day durable seen-id horizon, and §2.6's dedup-by-
     previously-acked set, which as written has no upper bound at all) this specification
     previously carried for what is conceptually one cache. **§16.1 and §16.10 need reconciling
     into a single cited parameter for this purpose, and §18.3.1's claim that `ts` is "used only
     for ordering/expiry, never for correctness" needs amending — `ts` now also gates a
     correctness/security check. Both are reported to their owning sections, not made here.**
   - **Deniable-mode parity.** The deniable 1:1 mode's first-message replay defense (§5.2.1(a))
     already enforces an equivalent bound for `DeniableInit`. This step brings the **default**
     (non-deniable) path to parity; the default path previously had none at all.
4. **Resolve `to`** to this node (or a group it belongs to). If `to` does not resolve, drop.
5. **Classify the sender** by `to`/pinning state: a **known contact** (fast path) vs an
   **unknown/cold sender**.
   **What `to` can and cannot tell you (normative).** Classification happens *before* decryption —
   that ordering is the whole decryption-DoS defense — so the only relationship signal available is
   `to`. A **`BlindedTag`** identifies the sender, because it is derived from a per-contact secret
   established at first contact (§2.2a); a **`GroupTag`** identifies the group. A **`KeyTag` does
   not**: it is the *recipient's own* identity key, and `sender_key` is a fresh ephemeral (§2.2), so
   a `KeyTag` envelope carries **no sender information whatsoever** at step 5.
   Therefore: **a `KeyTag` envelope MUST be classified COLD**, and a sender that is a known contact
   of the recipient **MUST address it by `BlindedTag`** (or `GroupTag` for an established group)
   once one has been established. `KeyTag` is the **first-contact** form, not the steady-state one.
   Without this rule step 5 is unexecutable on the documented default: two mutually pinned contacts
   using `KeyTag` and omitting `challenge` (which §2.2b permits for known contacts) would be
   classified cold, deferred, never acked, and the sender's queue would expire at 72 h — while the
   only alternative reading, treating an unidentifiable sender as *known*, deletes the cold-sender
   gate entirely.
6. **For cold senders, enforce anti-abuse policy (§9) NOW, before decryption**, using the
   `challenge` field (ARC token / PoW / stamp / vouch) — all checkable without decrypting.
   Reject or defer per §9.2 / §2.7a if the challenge is absent or insufficient.
7. Decrypt `ciphertext` (MLS epoch key or HPKE to recipient key); drop on failure. **Deniable
   fork (`kind = 0x0b`, §5.2.1):** if the envelope `kind` is `0x0b`, the `ciphertext` is a
   `DeniableFrame` (§18.3.9), **not** an MLS/HPKE-sealed `Payload`. Decryption is the **Double
   Ratchet** decrypt (a `DeniableInit` first establishes the X3DH/PQXDH session; a `DeniableMessage`
   advances the ratchet); the plaintext is a `DeniablePayload` (§18.3.10). A decrypt/ratchet
   failure is `ERR_DENIABLE_RATCHET_AUTH_FAILED` (`0x040D`, drop/hold-for-resync), never an
   MLS/HPKE decrypt attempt.
8. **Authenticate the sender and bind the envelope context**, as ordered sub-steps:
   - **(a) Payload signature (normal path).** Verify `Payload.sig` under `Payload.from`; **on
     failure, discard silently and do not `ack`** (fail closed, matching steps 1–3).
   - **(b) Envelope-context binding.** The `Payload.sig` preimage **binds the envelope's `kind`,
     `ts`, and `to`** (§18.9.2): recompute it using the received `Envelope`'s `kind`/`ts`/`to`
     and **reject any MOTE whose envelope `kind`/`ts`/`to` differ from the signed context**
     (`ERR_ENVELOPE_CONTEXT_MISMATCH`, `0x0211`). This stops a re-emitter from re-minting the
     anyone-can-mint `sender_sig` (step 3) over an altered `kind`/`ts`/`to` — rewriting the
     timestamp/causal order, or relabeling `kind` to change rendering or force a silent
     decrypt-fail.
   - **(b2) Vouch subject binding.** If the accepted `challenge` at step 6 was a **vouch**
     (§9.2a, §9.7), verify that **`Payload.from` equals `VouchToken.subject`**; on mismatch,
     discard silently and do not `ack` (`ERR_VOUCH_SUBJECT_MISMATCH`, `0x0126`).
     **Why this is required.** Unlike an ARC token, a PoW solution or a postage stamp, a vouch
     cannot be bound to the envelope's ephemeral `sender_key` at mint time — the voucher cannot
     know a key the vouchee has not yet generated, and a cleartext proof-of-possession over
     `sender_key` would break sealed sender (§6.2). §9.2a previously concluded from this that a
     stolen vouch needs no binding, because "the message still fails identity authentication at
     step 8". **That conclusion was wrong.** Step 8(a) verifies `Payload.sig` under
     `Payload.from` — a field the *thief* chooses and signs with their own key, so it succeeds.
     A vouch travels in the **cleartext** envelope by construction (§9.2a), so anyone on path can
     lift one and present it as their own, obtaining the strongest standing in the protocol
     (§9.7 bypasses VDF/PoW/stamp entirely) at zero cost — in a tier §9.7 describes as the one an
     adversary "cannot buy with either compute or money". Binding the vouch to the *subject it
     names* is the only check that can close this, and it necessarily lands here, after
     decryption, because `from` is not visible before it.
   - **(c) Pin check.** Otherwise verify `from` matches the pinned identity for a known contact,
     or TOFU-pin on first contact (§3.4). For a cold sender whose `from` is now revealed,
     re-apply block/allow lists.
   - **(d) Deniable fork (`kind = 0x0b`).** A `DeniablePayload` carries **no** `sig` — the
     substitute authenticator is the **Double-Ratchet AEAD tag** (the shared-key MAC) already
     checked at step 7. The recipient verifies that tag *instead of* `Payload.sig` (sub-steps
     (a)–(b); the deniable path binds the envelope context inside the ratchet AD instead,
     §18.9.10), binds `DeniablePayload.from` to the X3DH-authenticated `IK` (matching the pinned
     identity, §3.4), and **MUST reject any `DeniablePayload` that carries a signature field**
     (`ERR_DENIABLE_SIGNATURE_PRESENT`, `0x040F`) — a present signature would defeat the mode.
   - **(e) Suite-ratchet check (last — requires the now-revealed sender identity).** Verify
     `Envelope.suite` is **not below** this contact's pinned suite high-water-mark (§1.3); a
     below-water-mark suite is a downgrade attempt → reject to the requests area with a security
     warning (`ERR_SUITE_DOWNGRADE`, §21.4), never accept. This check MUST occur here, not at
     step 1, because sealed sender hides the sender until decryption; a recipient that has
     retired a suite for *itself* MAY additionally reject that `Envelope.suite` at step 1 as its
     own floor.

   **Unknown-kind gate (between steps 8 and 9, normative).** If `Envelope.kind` is unassigned,
   or assigned but not implemented by this node, the node MUST NOT `ack` and MUST NOT surface
   the MOTE; it MAY discard it or hold it (e.g. pending an upgrade). A node MUST NOT
   store-and-ack a kind it cannot validate (§21.16 forward-compatibility rule, §10.1) — an ack
   asserts validated delivery, which is impossible for semantics the node cannot check.
9. Apply `expires`, `refs`, `kind` semantics; store; `ack`.

   **Same-author gate for `edit`/`redact` (normative).** For `kind = edit` (`0x03`) or
   `kind = redact` (`0x04`), apply the referenced supersede/delete **only if** this MOTE's
   `Payload.from` equals the `Payload.from` of **every** MOTE named in `refs`, **as the recipient
   itself stored it** (the check is against the recipient's own recorded authorship of the
   target — never a claim carried by the incoming `edit`/`redact` itself). A `refs` target this
   node does not hold cannot be checked and MUST be treated as a mismatch (fail closed, not fail
   open).
   On mismatch — including an unresolvable `refs` target — the node MUST NOT apply the
   edit/redaction, MUST NOT surface it as the named author's own retraction or revision, and MUST
   discard the incoming MOTE **silently, without `ack`** (`ERR_EDIT_REDACT_AUTHOR_MISMATCH`,
   proposed `0x0212`, §21 registration needed) — deliberately the **same** disposition regardless
   of which of the two triggering conditions applied, so the check cannot become an authorship or
   existence oracle against a `refs` target a prober does not already know is present. This
   mirrors the disposition of a forged `sender_sig` (step 3): the sender's own retry independently
   reaches `EXPIRED` (§16.1); no explicit rejection is returned.
   **Why this is needed.** Without it, `edit`/`redact` had no same-author rule anywhere: §5.4 said
   only that they "reference a prior MOTE by `id` via `refs`," and §5.6.4 makes a durable redact
   remove-wins and unresurrectable across the owner's whole device cluster. Composed, any
   correspondent — in a 1:1 or a group — could permanently delete or silently rewrite another
   party's message in *the recipient's own view*, with a validly signed MOTE of their own. §24.7's
   public-profile lineage got this right ("`supersedes` is strictly *same-identity* history"); the
   messaging path now matches it.
   **Group moderation is a distinct kind, never a relaxed `edit`/`redact` (normative).** Where a
   deployment wants an admin/moderator (§5.8.2) to remove another member's post from a group, that
   is a **moderation action** — a different `kind`, rendered to members as an operator/moderator
   removal, never as the original author's own edit or retraction. `edit`/`redact` are reserved
   for same-author supersede/delete and MUST NOT be repurposed for moderation.
   **`reaction` (`0x02`) is unaffected.** A reaction does not claim to be the referenced author's
   own act — it is the *reactor's* own annotation on someone else's message — so it carries no
   authorship claim to impersonate, and this gate binds `edit`/`redact` only.

Known contacts MAY skip step 6 (they are pre-authorized). Only known-contact MOTEs reach
decryption on the fast path; unknown senders must pass the anonymous abuse gate first.

**Dedup ordering (normative).** Deduplication by `id` (§2.6) runs **after** classification
(step 5), never before, and its effect is **conditioned on that classification**:

- **Known contact** (pre-authorized, the step-5 fast path): a duplicate of a previously **acked**
  `id` is re-acked immediately without further processing — idempotent redelivery, and no oracle,
  because the sender is already authenticated.
- **Unknown/cold sender:** a duplicate MUST NOT be acked before the **step-6** abuse gate is
  satisfied. It is handled exactly as any other cold MOTE — challenged, or held per §2.7a — and only
  a sender that clears the gate may then receive the idempotent re-ack. **A cold duplicate MUST NOT
  short-circuit step 6.**
- A duplicate of an `id` held only in the deferred requests area follows §2.7a unchanged — held,
  not acked.

Running dedup before classification — **or re-acking a cold duplicate ahead of step 6** — would let a
duplicate probe short-circuit the abuse gate and turn the ack itself into an existence oracle. Step 5
classifies but **authenticates nothing**: a `KeyTag` envelope is forced COLD and carries no sender
information, and `sender_key` asserts no identity, so an attacker replaying any previously-acked
`ciphertext` under a throwaway `sender_key`, with no challenge presented, would otherwise obtain a
signed `ack` at zero cost — confirming that the recipient stored that exact content-hash. The gate,
not the classification step, is what makes the ack safe to emit.

### 2.7a Outcome of a failed/absent challenge (normative)

To reconcile §2.7 and §9.2, the disposition is by *degree*:

- **Invalid or forged** `challenge`, or failed `sender_sig`/`id` → **discard silently**, no
  user-visible effect, do not `ack` (except a duplicate of a previously **acked** `id`, which is
  re-acked per §2.6; a duplicate of an `id` held only in the requests area is never acked).
- **Absent or below policy threshold** (a cold sender with no/weak proof) → **defer to a
  "requests" area** (not the inbox), rate-limited, never silently dropped and never surfaced as
  a normal message, and **not `ack`ed** (a deferred cold MOTE is durably held but no receipt is
  sent — acking would confirm the recipient's existence to an unproven sender and falsely signal
  *delivered*; the sender's own retry reaches `EXPIRED`, §16.1). Deferred MOTEs are held for the
  **requests-area retention period** (30 days, §16.5), then auto-cleaned. The user MAY promote the
  sender (which pins them as a contact). Ack is owed **only** for inbox delivery (§19.3.1 step 9).
- **Unverified because the recipient was over its verification budget** (§9.4's over-budget path)
  → held in the separate **unverified-deferral holding class** (§16.5): small, capped, and retained
  for **≤ 24 h**, not 30 days. It MUST NOT be mixed into the requests area and MUST NOT count as
  having satisfied the §9.7a floor, because nothing has been checked about it.

**"Never silently dropped" governs VERIFIED input; refusing UNVERIFIED input is a different act
(normative).** The rule above forbids discarding a well-formed cold MOTE whose proof the recipient
*has checked* and found sufficient. It does **not** oblige a recipient to store input it has not
verified and cannot afford to verify. Past the aggregate requests-area budget (§16.5) a recipient
**MAY refuse unverified cold MOTEs outright**.

The distinction is load-bearing, and conflating the two produced a real defect. §9.4 requires
deferral **without verifying** once the memory-hard verification budget is exhausted — a budget
scoped per delivering connection, which an attacker multiplies for free across mix exits and
relays. With no aggregate cap and no permission to refuse, that composed into an unbounded
**durable-storage denial of service**: saturate the budget, then send unlimited cold MOTEs
carrying **garbage** in `challenge`, performing no work whatsoever, and a conformant node was
obliged to hold every one of them for 30 days. The §9.11 claim that native mail needs no filter
rested on a requests area that was, in that state, an unauthenticated write channel. A node that
cannot refuse unverified bytes has no floor to defend — it has a mailbox anyone can fill.

Implementations MUST NOT deliver an unproven cold MOTE to the inbox, and MUST NOT silently
discard a well-formed-but-under-threshold one without the requests-area affordance.

## 2.8 Why this shape

- **Content-addressed** → dedup, integrity, caching, and file chunking all fall out of `id`.
- **Three layers** → clean separation of *routing privacy* (outer), *authenticity*
  (envelope), and *confidentiality* (payload).
- **Sealed sender** → the network sees ciphertext to an opaque destination and nothing else.
- **One object, many kinds** → mail, chat, files, groups, and identity share the format, so
  the transport, store, and crypto are built once (§5).
