/**
 * signaling.ts — authenticated signaling client.
 *
 * Opens a WebSocket to a host signaling stream
 * (GET /api/peering/stream) and multiplexes offer/answer/ICE frames
 * over the "signal" channel defined by the OS ws.go Hub.
 *
 * Frame envelope (mirrors ws.go):
 *   { channel: "signal", from: <userID>, payload: <SignalPayload> }
 *
 * SignalPayload:
 *   { type: "offer"|"answer"|"ice"|"join"|"leave",
 *     session: <sessionID>,
 *     to: <peerID>,          // targeted delivery (optional; omit = broadcast)
 *     sdp: <string>,         // offer / answer
 *     candidate: <RTCIceCandidateInit>,
 *     nonce: <uuid>,         // replay-protection nonce (required when sig present)
 *     ts: <number>,          // signed epoch-ms timestamp (required when sig present)
 *     sig: <base64>,         // ECDSA P-256 signature over canonical payload
 *     pubKey: <base64>,      // sender's raw ECDSA public key (offer/answer only)
 *   }
 *
 * ── E2E peer authentication (security audit MEDIUM) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Problem: the `frame.from` field is stamped by the signaling server.  A
 * malicious server can set any `from` value to misroute or impersonate.
 * The `p.to` delivery filter is not sufficient protection.
 *
 * Solution implemented here:
 *
 *   1. PEER IDENTITY BINDING
 *      Each peer publishes its ECDSA P-256 public key in the "join" frame
 *      (`depositPubKey`).  The key is stored on first use (TOFU).  All
 *      subsequent offer/answer/ice frames from that peer must carry a valid
 *      ECDSA signature over a deterministic canonical message that includes
 *      the `from` field.  A server that stamps the wrong `from` causes the
 *      canonical reconstruction to differ → verification fails → frame dropped.
 *
 *   2. DTLS FINGERPRINT PINNING
 *      The canonical message for offer/answer includes the full SDP string,
 *      which in turn contains the DTLS fingerprint line
 *      (`a=fingerprint:sha-256 …`).  Signing the SDP implicitly pins the
 *      fingerprint: if a MITM signaling server replaces the SDP (and thus the
 *      fingerprint) the signature mismatch causes the frame to be dropped
 *      before `setRemoteDescription` is called.
 *
 *   3. KEY STORAGE MODEL (TOFU)
 *      The first pubkey seen for a given `from` is trusted.  Later joins from
 *      the same peer with a different key are ignored.  The security boundary
 *      is the server's JWT authentication, which binds `from` to an
 *      authenticated identity on the initial join.  A server that is honest at
 *      join time but dishonest later cannot forge frames because it does not
 *      hold the peer's private key.
 *
 *   Backward compatibility: when `signFrame` is null (e.g. fabricSignaling.js
 *   / BroadcastChannel stub), signing is skipped.  When `requirePeerAuth` is
 *   false (default) unsigned frames from peers without a stored key pass
 *   through.  Frames from peers WITH a stored key are always verified
 *   regardless of `requirePeerAuth`.

//
// ─── Server contract (audit MED — JWT in WS query string) ───────────────────
//   Default transport: the JWT is sent in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` request
//   header, NOT the URL query string (which leaks into access logs, the browser
//   history/Referer, and proxies). The server MUST, during the WS upgrade:
//     1. Read `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` (a comma-separated list of offered
//        subprotocols).
//     2. Find the entry beginning with `vula.token.`, strip that prefix, and
//        validate the remaining string as the Bearer JWT.
//     3. Complete the upgrade. Echoing a selected subprotocol back is optional
//        for browsers (an omitted response header still completes the
//        handshake); if the server does echo, it should echo a stable protocol
//        name and not the token value.
//   Tokens remain short-lived regardless of transport.
//
//   Legacy fallback: backends that cannot yet read the header may opt the
//   client back into the `?token=` query string by constructing the client with
//   `tokenTransport: 'query'`. This is OFF by default and exists only as a
//   migration shim.

 * This widening is TYPE-LEVEL ONLY. `_processSignal` already treated `p.type`

 * peer/server could already send any `type` value regardless of what this

 * module constructing outgoing frames via the typed `signal()` API. There
 * was never a runtime switch that rejected an unrecognised `type` — unknown
 * kinds already fell through to the same `dispatchEvent('signal', ...)` at
 * the bottom of `_processSignal`, same as after this change. The five
 * type-specific branches (TOFU import, anti-downgrade pinning, sig/nonce/ts
 * verification) are still keyed on exact `===` comparisons against the five
 * literal strings and are UNCHANGED by this widening — an app-level kind

 * signature-verification branch (it isn't `'offer' | 'answer' | 'ice'`), and
 * still cannot enter the join TOFU/anti-downgrade branches (it isn't
 * `'join'`). See the mutation tests in replay-timestamp.test.ts ("rejects a
 * frame with a tampered signature" / "rejects an exact replay") that plant
 * an invalid signature and a replayed nonce and assert they are still

// `depositPubKey` (identity), `boxPubKey` (X25519 encryption), `signedPreKey`
// (X3DH prekey enabling FORWARD SECRECY) and a `supportsV2` capability flag.
//
// The signaling/relay server is UNTRUSTED transport.  Without an authenticated
// commitment a malicious server can simply STRIP the `signedPreKey` field from a
// join — the receiver then stores no prekey and the sender silently falls back to
// the v1 static-static path (no forward secrecy).  Forgery is already blocked
// (the SPK carries its own ECDSA signature, verified before storage) but OMISSION
// was not detectable.
//
// Signing this CAPABILITY COMMITMENT with the peer's ECDSA identity key closes
// the hole:
//   • DOWNGRADE: the signed `supportsV2:true` flag commits that the peer is
//     forward-secrecy capable.  A receiver that verifies it PINS the peer as
//     v2-capable; a sender then refuses any v1 path for that peer (fail closed),
//     so a stripped/omitted SPK is treated as an attack rather than legacy.
//   • IDENTITY/BOX BINDING: depositPubKey + boxPubKey are bound to the same
//     signature, so a server cannot swap the encryption key under a v2 claim.
//
// IMPORTANT — the mutable `signedPreKey` is DELIBERATELY NOT part of this
// signature.  The SPK carries its OWN ECDSA signature (`spk.sig`, verified before
// storage), so it is independently authenticated.  Keeping it out of the join
// commitment is what makes a STRIPPED SPK *detectable*: if the SPK were inside
// this signature, stripping it would merely invalidate the whole join sig and the
// peer would look like an unsigned legacy peer (silent downgrade).  By signing
// only the capability, a stripped SPK still leaves a VALID `supportsV2` signature
// → the receiver pins v2 → the absent SPK is caught as a downgrade, not legacy.
//
