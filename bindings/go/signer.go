// Signer produces an Ed25519 signature over a preimage the engine hands it.
//
// # Why this exists instead of a seed argument
//
// There is no entry point in this binding that accepts a private key, and adding one would be a
// security regression rather than a convenience. The engine runs inside a WebAssembly module whose
// linear memory is an ordinary byte slice on the Go heap: it is visible to anything that can read
// this process's memory, it is copied wholesale whenever the runtime grows it, it is not mlock'd,
// and it cannot be reliably zeroed. Handing a raw Ed25519 seed across that boundary would take a
// key that could have lived in an HSM, an agent, or a KMS and spread copies of it through a heap
// nothing is defending.
//
// So signing is detached, exactly as it is on the JS surface (which signs with a non-extractable
// WebCrypto CryptoKey for the same reason). The engine emits the RFC 9052 Sig_structure; your
// Signer signs it wherever the key actually lives; the engine verifies the result before it will
// assemble an envelope. The key never enters the module, and the module never asks for it.
//
// The insecure path is absent, not discouraged: TestNoEntryPointAcceptsKeyMaterial asserts the
// module's own dispatch table has no entry point that takes key material, so the property is
// checked on every run rather than maintained by remembering to be careful.
//
// # Implementing one
//
// The preimage is the exact bytes to sign — do not hash, prefix, or re-encode it. Return the raw
// 64-byte Ed25519 signature. Any error is propagated to the caller unchanged, and a custodian that
// silently fails cannot produce a valid envelope: the engine verifies before returning, so a wrong
// signature is caught here rather than on some other replica's ingest path hours later.
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use if the surrounding [Instance] or [Pool] is used
// concurrently.
