// The staleness guard for the committed wasm artifact.
//
// kotva_sync_abi.wasm is committed, because a Go module has no build step: `go get` runs neither
// `go generate` nor build-abi.sh, so a gitignored artifact makes this module simply uncompilable
// for anyone consuming it normally. Both products that adopted the engine hit that and vendored
// the file by hand instead.
//
// But committing it re-opens the exact drift this repo has already been bitten by once: a stale
// checked-in module kept aborting on free long after src/abi.rs had been fixed, and the failure
// looked intermittent because whether it manifested depended on a String's capacity happening to
// equal its length. Nothing in git ties a binary blob to the source that produced it.
//
// So the blob is tied to its source here instead. wasm_provenance.json records a digest over every
// Rust input that feeds the artifact; this test recomputes that digest and fails when it moves.
// The check deliberately does NOT rebuild — a rebuild would need a Rust toolchain and a wasm32
// target, which a Go consumer has no reason to install, and a guard that hard-fails on a Go-only
// machine would be worse than no guard at all. Hashing source inputs needs nothing but the files.
//
// When it fails, the fix is to rebuild and re-record, not to edit the digest:
//
//	crates/kotva-sync-wasm/build-abi.sh
//	(cd bindings/go && go run ./internal/genprovenance)   # no go.mod at the repo root

// TestArtifactIsNotStaleAgainstSource is the guard that matters: it fails when the Rust source has
// moved since the artifact was built, which is the drift that previously shipped a real bug.
//
// # Absent sources: two different situations, and only one of them is benign
//
// This test used to skip on a single condition — the wasm crate directory is not there — which
// conflates a consumer who fetched only the Go module through the proxy (nothing to check, nothing
// they could fix) with a checkout in which the Rust *moved*. The second is no longer hypothetical:
// `dmtap-sync`/`dmtap-sync-wasm` WERE extracted out of envoir, into this repo, as `kotva-sync`/
// `kotva-sync-wasm`, and this binding moved with them. Under the old single condition that day
// would have been the day this guard went permanently green by doing nothing, which is the worst
// available outcome for a staleness check. Under this one it failed loudly and was fixed.
//
// So the two are told apart by whether a *repo* is present around this module. A standalone module
// fetch is rooted in the module cache and has no Cargo workspace and no git directory above it; a
// kotva checkout has both. Sources missing with a repo around them is drift, and drift fails.
//
// The benign skip states its reason on stderr as well as through `t.Skip`. Be precise about how far
// that gets: `go test` buffers a package's output and DISCARDS it when the package passes, so under
// a bare `go test` the notice is not shown and the package still prints only `ok` — measured, not
// assumed. It is shown under `-v`, `-json`, and any wrapper built on those (gotestsum, CI). There
// is no channel a passing Go test can write to that a bare `go test` will display; the only way to
// be unconditionally loud is to fail, and failing a consumer who legitimately has no Rust tree
// would be wrong. So: loud where anything is looking, and the drift cases above — which are the
// ones that can actually hide a bug — fail rather than skip.
