// TestModuleImportsNothing is a security property before it is a portability one.

// A module with zero imports cannot reach anything it is not handed: no WASI, no host functions,
// no clock, no filesystem, no network, no randomness. The engine can only read and write its own
// linear memory, so "the sync engine exfiltrated something" is not a threat that needs mitigating
// — it is a shape the module cannot express.
//
// It is also why instantiation costs ~90 µs and why the Go host needs no glue: there is nothing to
// supply. An import appearing here would mean a dependency started reaching for the host
// environment, which must be a deliberate, reviewed change rather than a transitive surprise.
