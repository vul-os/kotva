//go:generate ../../crates/kotva-sync-wasm/build-abi.sh

// engineWasm is the sync engine: kotva-sync and kotva-core compiled to WebAssembly through the
// raw-ABI surface of crates/kotva-sync-wasm (its src/abi.rs), with wasm-opt -Oz applied.
//
// # It is committed, and tied to its source by a test
//
// kotva_sync_abi.wasm is checked in, so `go get` works and this module compiles from a plain proxy
// fetch. Rebuild it after changing the Rust with:
//
//	crates/kotva-sync-wasm/build-abi.sh     # or: go generate ./bindings/go
//	(cd bindings/go && go run ./internal/genprovenance)
//
// The parentheses are not decoration: there is no go.mod at the repo root, so `go run
// ./bindings/go/internal/genprovenance` from there fails with "cannot find main module".
//
// Committing it was not the first choice. Gitignoring it was, on the reasoning that a missing file
// is a build error you cannot ignore while a stale one is a bug you can ship — and that reasoning
// came from a real incident: a committed module went stale against a fix in src/abi.rs, and every
// response whose Rust-side String capacity outran its length aborted the allocator on free. The
// drift was invisible because nothing in git ties a binary blob to the code that produced it.
//
// What overruled it is that a Go module has no build step. `go get` runs neither `go generate` nor
// build-abi.sh, so a gitignored artifact makes this package uncompilable for anyone consuming it
// the normal way. Both products that adopted the engine hit exactly that and vendored the file by
// hand — each re-accepting the same staleness risk, privately, with no shared guard.
//
// So the blob is tied to its source explicitly instead of implicitly. wasm_provenance.json records
// a digest over every Rust input; provenance_test.go recomputes it and fails when the source has
// moved. It hashes rather than rebuilds, so it needs no Rust toolchain. Adopters no longer need to
// vendor, and the guard lives here once instead of in each of them.
//
// Absent sources are not one case but two, and the guard separates them: a standalone module fetch
// (no crates/ tree AND no repo around it) has nothing to check, and skips with a NOTICE on stderr;
// a checkout in which crates/ is simply GONE is drift, and FAILS. That distinction has now EARNED
// itself: kotva-sync and kotva-sync-wasm did move — out of envoir and into this repo, taking this
// binding with them — and the one-condition version of this check would have gone permanently,
// silently green on that day. It instead failed with "the Rust sources this artifact was built
// from are GONE", which is exactly what it was written to do, and the artifact was rebuilt and
// re-recorded against the new paths rather than the record being edited to match. The NOTICE is visible under `go test -v`/`-json` but not under a bare `go test`, which
// discards a passing package's output — see provenance_test.go for why that is where it stops.
//
// Do not substitute a module built any other way. The whole value of this binding is that these are
// the same bytes of algebra the native Rust runner and the browser binding execute, which
// vectors_test.go proves against the 22 frozen conformance vectors.
//
// The module imports nothing at all — no WASI, no host functions, no clock, no filesystem, no
// network. TestModuleImportsNothing asserts that, because it is a security property (the engine
// cannot reach anything it is not handed) as much as a portability one.
