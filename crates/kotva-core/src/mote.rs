//! The MOTE object — spec §2.
//!
//! A MOTE is a signed, encrypted, content-addressed message object: the atomic unit of DMTAP.
//! Mail, chat, files, group events, and identity announcements are all MOTEs. Three nested
//! layers: outer (mixnet / sealed-sender, §4/§6 — not modeled here), **envelope** (signed,
//! per-recipient, §2.2), and **payload** (E2E ciphertext, §2.4).
//!
//! This module implements the envelope + payload, real Ed25519 signatures, HPKE payload
//! sealing (suite `0x01`), content addressing, and the **ordered recipient validation** of
//! §2.7 — cheap/anonymous checks *before* any decryption (a decryption-DoS defense).
//!
//! ## Reference-implementation notes (where the wire shape is pinned down)
//! - `sender_sig` is a detached signature by an *ephemeral* per-message key (§2.2). The wire
//!   format carries the matching public key explicitly in `Envelope.sender_key` (§2.2 field 12,
//!   CDDL key 12, §18.3.1) so the recipient can verify it in step 3 without decrypting; this
//!   reference exposes it as `Envelope.sender_eph`. The `challenge` proof is bound to that key
//!   (§9.2a) so a stripped proof cannot be replayed under a different ephemeral key.
//! - Payload sealing is abstracted behind [`PayloadSeal`]; [`Hpke`] is the real suite-`0x01`
//!   implementation (RFC 9180 DHKEM(X25519)/HKDF-SHA256/ChaCha20-Poly1305 via the `hpke`
//!   crate). Suite `0x02` (PQ) would supply a different `PayloadSeal`.
