//! DMTAP-RTC — real-time call **signaling** and **capacity advertisement** (spec §27).
//!
//! ## What this module is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! DMTAP does not invent a real-time media stack, and neither does this module. Media transport,
//! codecs, congestion control, and the SFU are **WebRTC's** problem and are solved: SRTP for the
//! wire, SDP (RFC 8866) for the session description, JSEP (RFC 8829) for the offer/answer state
//! machine, ICE/STUN/TURN (RFC 8445/8489/8656) for connectivity, and SFrame (RFC 9605) for the
//! end-to-end frame protection that survives an SFU. A DMTAP call must be implementable against an
//! *existing* SFU, which means DMTAP must not require the SFU to understand anything new.
//!
//! DMTAP contributes exactly three things, and this module holds two of them:
//!
//! 1. **[`RtcSignal`]** (kind [`RTC_SIGNAL_KIND`] `0x44`, §27.4.1) — the offer/answer/candidate/
//!    rollback/teardown object, carried as ordinary `Payload.body` inside a sealed MOTE (§2/§5).
//!    It is authenticated by the enclosing `Payload.sig` exactly as any other MOTE content is; it
//!    carries no signature of its own (§27.8's KDF-labels row), and — unlike a signed object such
//!    as [`FeedHint`](crate::pubsub::FeedHint) — it is not even re-preserved verbatim when a key
//!    is unrecognized, because it is never re-relayed, re-serialized or content-addressed by
//!    anyone but its one recipient (§27.4.1's forward-compatibility paragraph).
//! 2. **Capacity accounting** ([`MediaCapacity`], [`CapacityAdvert`], [`RtcCapacity`]) — an
//!    *advertised*, resource-derived ceiling expressed in tracks and bits/sec, never a guess by
//!    the far side and never a headcount (§27.7.4).
//!
//! The third — SFrame key derivation from the MLS epoch secret — lives in `dmtap-mls::sframe`,
//! because that is where the epoch secret is, and it must not be copied out of the MLS layer to
//! get here.
//!
//! ## Why one message kind and not several
//!
//! `Envelope.kind` travels **in the clear** (§2.2): it is on the signed envelope, outside the
//! sealed `ciphertext`. Allocating a kind per signaling object — `offer`, `answer`, `bye` — would
//! publish the *state of a call* to every relay on the path: who called whom, whether the callee
//! picked up, and when they hung up. That is precisely the call-detail record DMTAP exists to not
//! produce. So every signal type shares one kind, [`RTC_SIGNAL_KIND`], and the discriminator
//! ([`SignalType`], key 2) sits **inside** the sealed payload where only the recipient reads it
//! (§27.3.2). The cost is that a relay cannot prioritize a teardown over a candidate; that is a
//! scheduling nicety traded for not leaking call state, and the trade is not close.
//!
//! ## Renegotiation is not a type
//!
//! There is no `renegotiate` [`SignalType`]. Adding a screen share, removing it, adding a second
//! camera, restarting ICE, and changing simulcast layers are all the same operation: **an ordinary
//! `offer` with a higher `seq` on an existing `call_id`** (§27.4.4). A receiver that already holds
//! that `call_id` in an established state treats the new `offer` as a renegotiation instead of a
//! new call; nothing in the object itself distinguishes the two cases; the call state the receiver
//! already holds does.
//!
//! ## Screen sharing is not a call type
//!
//! A screen share is an **additional media track**, produced by `getDisplayMedia()`, added to a
//! live call by ordinary JSEP renegotiation (an `offer` per above). There is no screen-share
//! object here, no screen-share flag, and no screen-share key. Its *purpose* is carried
//! SDP-natively as `a=content:slides` (RFC 4796 §5.14, §27.6.2), read back out by [`sdp_scan`] —
//! DMTAP adds no parallel application-level purpose field that could disagree with the SDP the
//! media stack actually acts on. Two facts follow, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! - **A screen track cannot be unencrypted.** [`sdp_scan`] refuses any media section offered over
//!   a non-SRTP profile ([`RtcError::UnprotectedMedia`], `ERR_RTC_SFRAME_REQUIRED` `0x0417`),
//!   uniformly, before any purpose is even looked at. There is no code path that admits a `slides`
//!   section on plain `RTP/AVP`.
//! - **A screen track cannot be differently keyed.** The key derivation in `dmtap_mls::sframe`
//!   takes no track argument at all — see that module's docs. Uniform keying is a property of the
//!   API's *shape*, not of a check someone has to remember to run. See
//!   `dmtap_mls::sframe::tests::screen_and_camera_track_derive_the_identical_secret` for the test
//!   that proves it.
//!
//! ## Registry status (§21.24f, §27.8)
//!
//! Every identifier this module allocates is now **registered**, not provisional: message kind
//! `0x44` (§21.16), capability tokens `rtc-1`/`rtc-sfu-1` (§21.22), error points `0x0415`–`0x0417`
//! within the existing subsystem `0x04` (§21.14), and the MLS exporter label
//! `DMTAP-RTC-v0/sframe` (§18.9). Where an earlier revision of this file predates `27-realtime-
//! media.md` and disagrees with it, the spec governs (§10.4) and the disagreement is fixed here,
//! not carried forward — see the `dmtap-envoir` change log for what changed and why.
