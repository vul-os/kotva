//! [`SnapshotBody`] — what a fast-joining replica actually transfers and adopts (`SYNC.md` §6.1.2,
//! frozen as `SYNC-SNAP-03`), plus §6.2's body-retention obligation.
//!
//! # The body is a set of ops, not a state document
//!
//! ```cddl
//! SnapshotBody = [ * ( COSE_Sign1(SyncOp) / SyncFrame ) ]   ; framed per §5.2's op-framing rule
//! ```
//!
//! It is the **minimal set of canonical, individually-signed ops whose fold equals the snapshot's
//! observable state**, served by `GET /sync/state/<root>` and optionally inlined at `FastJoin` key
//! `3`. A replica adopts it by ingesting every member **through the ordinary op path of §4** — same
//! signature check, same `ext-value` validation, same CRDT apply, same `op-id` dedup. There is no
//! second ingest path here, and §6.1.2 is explicit that an implementation is not required to have
//! one.
//!
//! # Why `ObservableState` cannot be the body (§14 C-09)
//!
//! [`ObservableState`](crate::snapshot::ObservableState) is the *observable projection* — which is
//! exactly what makes `root` a clean equality object and exactly what makes it useless as a base
//! state. §6.1.1 drops, per kind, the one field the **next** merge needs:
//!
//! | Kind | Dropped | What breaks |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | §4.4 LWW | the winning cell's HLC | nothing to compare a later op against |
//! | §4.5 `death` | the certificate's HLC | §4.5's strictly-greater revival test is unevaluable |
//! | §4.3 OR-Set | the add-tags | a later `set-remove` cancels nothing; add-wins ⇒ add-always |
//! | §4.7 RGA | element ids | every post-`covers` insert strands in the readiness buffer |
//! | §4.6 PN | per-`op-id` deltas | a below-`covers` op arriving late is double-counted |
//!
//! The LWW case is the sharpest, and it is the one `SYNC-SNAP-03` freezes: `covers` bounds each
//! author's **own stream**, while the §3 HLC is a total order **across authors**. So an op that is
//! genuinely after `covers` can still sit *below* the incumbent. The vector's demo is post-`covers`
//! op `(W,3,B)` against incumbent `(W,4,A)`: a replica that folded the body keeps `"n"`, a replica
//! that adopted the projection has the value but not its HLC, applies the write, and lands on `"q"`
//! — **a different root, permanently, with no error raised on either side.**
//!
//! # Fold-then-recompute
//!
//! `Snapshot.root` still commits to `det_cbor(ObservableState)` (§6.1.1 is unchanged, every frozen
//! byte stands). So a body is verified by folding it and **recomputing** that hash, never by
//! hashing the received bytes:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ingest every op in SnapshotBody  →  derive ObservableState per §6.1.1  →  hash  ≟  Snapshot.root
//! ```
//!
//! That is strictly stronger than hashing an opaque blob, because it proves the ops actually
//! *produce* the committed state rather than only that someone shipped the bytes they promised. It
//! also shrinks the §6.1 trusted-checkpoint residual: every member is independently COSE-signed, so
//! a malicious signer can **omit** ops (detectable as a vector that never advances) but cannot
//! **forge** one. A mismatch is `ERR_SYNC_SNAPSHOT_ROOT_MISMATCH` (`0x0A09`) and the body is
//! discarded **whole** — which is why [`SnapshotBody::verify_against_root`] folds into a
//! *provisional* state it returns only on success, leaving the caller's live replica untouched.
