# DMTAP Conformance Test-Case Catalog

This is the **normative test-case catalog** referenced by spec §10.3 — the *operational
definition of compatibility*. An implementation, **in any language**, is DMTAP-conformant at a
level (§10.3: Core / Private / Groups&Files / Legacy / Clients / Auth) **iff** it produces the
expected result for every `MUST` case at that level (and the cases of every level it composes).
"DMTAP-compatible" means "passes this suite," not "resembles the reference" (§10.3, §10.4).

The machine-readable form of this catalog is [`suite.json`](suite.json); the byte-exact inputs it
drives are [`vectors/vectors.json`](vectors/vectors.json) (see [`README.md`](README.md) for the
runner contract and provenance). This `.md` is the human-readable, clause-cross-referenced twin of
`suite.json`: the two carry the **same case ids** and MUST stay in sync.

## How to read a case

Each case has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **id** | Stable identifier, `DMTAP-<CATEGORY>-<NN>`. Never reused. |
| **level** | The §10.3 level it belongs to (Core, Private, Groups&Files, Legacy, Clients, Auth). |
| **req** | `MUST` or `SHOULD` (RFC 2119). A level passes only if every `MUST` at that level passes. |
| **clause** | The exact normative spec clause (§-ref) the case pins. |
| **checks** | What behaviour is asserted. |
| **input** | A **vector id** in `vectors.json`, an inline **self-contained construction** (bytes given here), or a **construction** described from other vectors. |
| **expect** | The required outcome: `match` (recompute a KAT and get the committed answer), `accept` (validation passes), or `reject` + the **§21 error code** the reject maps to. |
| **status** | `vectored` (byte-backed by `vectors.json`), `self-contained` (bytes given inline, reference-independent), or `construction-todo` (recipe given; byte-exact vector still to be generated). |

**Outcome vocabulary.** `match` = the operation is a deterministic known-answer test; recompute
it over the fixed input and the result MUST equal the committed `expected`. `accept` / `reject` =
the operation is a validation predicate; a conforming node MUST accept (resp. reject) the input,
and on `reject` MUST map it to the named §21 error code with that code's `Action` disposition
(DROP_SILENT / DEFER_REQUESTS / FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK / HALT_ALERT / ACK_DEDUP …).

## Coverage summary

| Level | Cases | Vectored | Self-contained | Construction-todo |
|-------|------:|---------:|---------------:|------------------:|
| **Core** — canonical CBOR (`CBOR`) | 12 | 4 | 6 | 2 |

| **Private** (`PRIV`) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **Groups & Files** (`GRP`, `FILE`) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |

| **Clients** (`CLI`) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **Auth** (`AUTH`) | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **Private** — deniable 1:1 mode (`DENIABLE`) | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **Core** — org administration (`ORG`) | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **Private** — KT-v1 hardening (`KTV1`) | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| **Core** — device attestation (`ATTEST`) | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| **Core** — profile / avatar (`PROFILE`) | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| **Optional** — push wake-signaling (`PUSH`) | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| **Total** | **104** | **33** | **6** | **65** |

The 33 vectored + 6 self-contained cases (**39**) are fully machine-runnable **today** from
`vectors.json` + the inline bytes here, with **no reference implementation required**. They pin the
entire deterministic, security-critical Core spine — canonical CBOR, content addressing, the two
MOTE signature preimages (§18.9.1/§18.9.2), Ed25519 (with RFC 8032 cross-checks), the 8-word
key-name, safety numbers, and suite fail-closed. The 65 `construction-todo` cases give the exact
recipe and expected §21 error for every remaining normative branch (the full §2.7 pipeline,
identity/KT fail-closed, the higher levels, the wave-2 hardening families —
`DENIABLE`/`ORG`/`KTV1`/`ATTEST` — the `PROFILE` display-data guards, and the optional `PUSH`
wake-signaling guards); each becomes byte-backed
when the corresponding subsystem gains a fixed-input KAT in `vectors.json` (see README "Coverage vs.
deferred"). **Sync status:** `SUITE.md` and [`suite.json`](suite.json) are **in sync** — both carry
the same **104** case ids (the wave-2 `DENIABLE`/`KTV1` families, the `PROFILE` cases, and the
optional `PUSH` cases are mirrored into `suite.json`). The changed deniable objects (§5.2.1 dedicated-`idk`) are still to be
re-vectored when the reference regenerates `vectors.json`.

> All 39 byte-backed cases correspond one-for-one to entries in `vectors.json`
> (they drive **32 of the 67 vectors** in the file — several vectors drive more than one case;
> the remaining 35 are pre-generated for construction-todo families not yet wired to a case).
> No case references a `vectors.json` entry that does not exist; see
> [Vector cross-reference](#vector-cross-reference).

## Core level

Core is the interoperability floor (§10.3): Identity (§1), MOTE (§2), naming + TOFU + fail-closed
KT (§3), delivery + `deliver`/`ack` (§4), MLS 1:1 (§5), recipient policy incl. cold-sender
challenge gating (§9). A production mail node MUST also implement **Private** (§10.3). Every Core
crypto/encoding case below is a prerequisite the higher levels inherit.

### CBOR — deterministic canonical encoding (§18.1.1, §18.1.2)

| DMTAP-CBOR-12 | MUST | §18.1.2 | a decoder of a **signed** object rejects any unknown integer key `≥ 64` (fail closed, so the signing preimage stays unambiguous) | construction: take `cbor_payload`, insert key `64` (`0x1840`) `=> 0`, re-sort keys | reject → `ERR_MALFORMED_OBJECT` (0x020D) | construction-todo |

> *signed*-object fail-closed rule specifically. `Headers.ext` text-keyed extension is the only
> text-key surface (§18.3.6) and is out of scope for the integer-key rules above.

### VAL — the §2.7 ordered recipient-validation pipeline

The full ordered pipeline (§2.7), each step mapped to its authoritative §21.4 disposition. Steps
2, 3 and 8's positive path are already byte-backed by ADDR-05/06, PRE-02 and PRE-03; the remaining
branches give the exact reject code and disposition and are `construction-todo` (they need a full
sealed `Envelope`/`Payload` fixture, which is non-deterministic to *seal* — see README "deferred").

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-VAL-01 | MUST | §2.7 step 1, §10.1 | unknown `v`/`suite` rejected **first**, before any crypto | construction: `Envelope` with `v=1` (or unknown `suite`) | reject → `ERR_UNKNOWN_VERSION_OR_SUITE` (0x0201), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |

## Private level (§4.4, §6)

Core + mixnet (Sphinx + directory + 3-hop stratified paths + key-epoch rotation) + sealed sender +
cover traffic + anti-active-adversary mechanisms + fail-closed no-downgrade + privacy tiers. A
**production** mail node MUST implement Private (§10.3): `private` is the standing default tier
(§4.6). No byte-exact vectors exist yet (Sphinx uses fresh randomness; see README "deferred");
each case gives the normative check and error.

| DMTAP-PRIV-05 | MUST | §4.4.8 | loop-cover / active-attack suspicion is surfaced, not ignored | reject → `ERR_MIX_ACTIVE_ATTACK_SUSPECTED` (0x030F) | construction-todo |

## Groups & Files level (§5)

Core + MLS groups + content-addressed file transfer. MLS handshake bytes (RFC 9420) are carried
opaquely by DMTAP and are not vectored (README "deferred"); the DMTAP-native Merkle-DAG manifest
(§18.9.5) is deterministic and SHOULD be vectored next.

## Deniable 1:1 mode (§5.2.1) — `DENIABLE`

The optional repudiable mode's fail-closed guards and the dedicated-`idk` handshake. The mode is
capability-negotiated (Private-level optional); the reject guards below are MUST **when the mode is
implemented**. No byte-exact vectors yet (Double Ratchet / X3DH use fresh randomness — the
dedicated `idk` change is flagged for re-vectoring, see README "deferred").

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|

## Organization administration (§3.10, §13.5.1) — `ORG`

## KT-v1 hardening (§3.5.2) — `KTV1`

Optional (log-type `0x02`, negotiated); the equivocation/quorum guards are MUST **when v1 is
implemented**. RFC 6962-profiled objects (`SignedTreeHead`/`InclusionProof`/`ConsistencyProof`,
§18.4.9–§18.4.11).

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-KTV1-01 | MUST | §3.5.2(a),(d), §18.4.9 | two validly-signed STHs of one log with equal `tree_size` but differing `root_hash` (or no consistency proof) ⇒ equivocation: HALT + alert + publish evidence | reject → `ERR_KT_STH_INCONSISTENT` (0x0110) + `ERR_KT_EQUIVOCATION` (0x0107), HALT_ALERT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-KTV1-02 | MUST | §3.5.2(b), §18.4.10 | a `name → ik` binding not attested by a `> n/2` quorum of the pinned log set fails closed → OOB | reject → `ERR_KT_LOG_QUORUM_UNMET` (0x0111), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-KTV1-03 | MUST | §3.5.2(a), §16.2 | a `SignedTreeHead` older than the freshness window (freeze attack) is treated as stale and refreshed | reject → `ERR_KT_STH_STALE` (0x0112), HOLD_RESYNC | construction-todo |

## Device attestation (§1.2a) — `ATTEST`

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-ATTEST-01 | MUST | §1.2a, §18.4.2 | an attestation-gated context rejects a device whose `key_protection`/`attestation` is absent or fails against the platform root (advisory — never overrides §1.4 authority) | reject → `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_INVALID` (0x0116), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-ATTEST-02 | MUST | §1.2a, §18.4.2, §16.9 | evidence older than the re-attestation cadence (≤ 90 d), past its window, or chaining only to a retired root is treated as expired → re-attest | reject → `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_EXPIRED` (0x0118), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

---

## Profile — human display data (§3.9.5) — `PROFILE`

The self-asserted, signed display object (`display_name` / name parts / avatar). Signed by the
`IK` (or an `IK`-authorized device key) and authenticated to the key exactly like `Identity.names`
— a replaceable pointer, never a real-world-identity claim. No byte-exact vectors yet (a signed
`Profile` KAT is added when the reference gains the object); the reject guards below are MUST.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-PROFILE-01 | MUST | §3.9.5, §18.4.12, §18.9.3 | a `Profile` whose `sig` (DS-tag `DMTAP-v0/profile`) does not verify under the identity's `IK` / an `IK`-authorized device key is rejected; the prior pinned profile (or the fallback ladder) is used | reject → `ERR_PROFILE_SIG_INVALID` (0x0119), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-PROFILE-02 | MUST | §3.9.5, §18.4.12 | a `Profile` whose `avatar.hash` is present but the bytes fetched from `avatar.url` do **not** content-address (`0x1e ‖ BLAKE3-256`) to it MUST NOT be displayed; the client falls back down the §3.9.5 ladder (key-derived identicon → initials) and warns | reject → `ERR_PROFILE_AVATAR_HASH_MISMATCH` (0x011A), USER_WARN | construction-todo |

---

## Push wake-signaling (§4.9, OPTIONAL) — `PUSH`

The optional wake layer (§4.9): a device registers a `PushSubscription` with its own node, and the
node emits a content-free, sender-blind `WakePing`. Push is **not required for Core** (§10.3) — these
guards are conditional and MUST hold **only when a node implements the optional `push-wake`
capability** (§10.2, §21.22), mirroring how the `DENIABLE` guards apply only when the deniable mode is
implemented. No byte-exact vectors yet (RFC 8291 sealing uses fresh randomness); the reject guards
below are MUST.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-PUSH-01 | MUST | §4.9.1, §18.5.6, §18.9.15 | a `WakePing` carrying any field beyond the opaque sealed token (key `1`) — or whose opened plaintext bears sender/subject/recipient/content — MUST be rejected: a wake is content-free and sender-blind | reject → `ERR_WAKEPING_CONTENT_PRESENT` (0x0313), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-PUSH-02 | MUST | §4.9.1, §4.9.4, §18.5.5, §18.9.15 | a `PushSubscription` whose `sig` does not verify under an `IK`-authorized `device_key` (§1.2) MUST be rejected and never woken against — the subscription must be authenticated to the identity | reject → `ERR_PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_SIG_INVALID` (0x0312), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

## Vector cross-reference

Every `vectored` case above maps to an existing entry in `vectors/vectors.json`
(**32 of the 67 vectors** in the file are referenced by cases). Cross-check (case → vector):

| vectors.json entry | driven by case(s) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `content_address_empty` / `_small` / `_phrase` / `_multi_kib` | ADDR-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 |
| `mote_content_address_ok` / `_tampered` | ADDR-05 / ADDR-06 (= VAL-02) |
| `ed25519_rfc8032_test1` / `_test2` | SIG-01 / SIG-02 |
| `ed25519_domain_separated` | SIG-03 |
| `ed25519_verify_ok` / `_tampered_msg` / `_tampered_sig` | SIG-04 / SIG-05 / SIG-06 |
| `mote_sender_sig` / `mote_sender_sig_verify` | PRE-01 / PRE-02 (= VAL-03 base) |
| `mote_payload_sig` | PRE-03 (= VAL-08 base) |
| `keyname_zero_key` / `_key_ones` / `_key_twos` / `_real_pubkey` | NAME-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 (-05 derives from -02/-03) |
| `keyname_typo_rejected` | NAME-06 |
| `safety_number_pair_ab` / `_order_independent` | SAFE-01 / SAFE-02 |
| `suite_reject_0x00` / `_0x03` / `_0x05` / `_0xff` | SUITE-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 |
| `suite_accept_0x01` / `_0x02` | SUITE-05 / SUITE-06 |
| `cbor_identity` / `cbor_device_cert` / `cbor_payload` / `cbor_envelope` | CBOR-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 |

No case references a vector that is absent from `vectors.json`. The six `self-contained` CBOR
reject cases (CBOR-05…CBOR-10) carry their bytes inline here and in `suite.json` and need no
reference implementation. The `construction-todo` cases carry a byte-exact recipe and the expected
§21 error; they are wired byte-for-byte as their subsystems gain fixed-input KATs (README
"Coverage vs. deferred").
